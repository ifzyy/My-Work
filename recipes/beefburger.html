<div class="beefburger"><h3><em>Steps:</em> </h3></div>
<ol>
    <p><li>Place feed shaft, blade, and 1/4-inch die of meat grinder in the freezer until well-chilled. Arrange beef sirloin, beef chuck, and beef brisket chunks on rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between each piece and freeze for 10 minutes until meat is firm, but not frozen.</li></p>
   <p> <li>Combine beef and pass meat through grinder twice. Shape ground meat evenly into four patties about 2 inches thick and 5 inches wide. Refrigerate until ready to grill.</li></p>
    <p><li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Brush kaiser buns with melted butter.</li></p>
   <p> <li>Arrange bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.</li></p>
   <p> <li>Toast buns on the preheated grill until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from grill and set aside.</li></p>
    <p><li>Place beef patties on the grill and cook until burgers are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Top each patty with a slice of Cheddar cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.</li></p>
    <p><li>Stir mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, dill pickle, garlic powder, and paprika in a bowl; spread mixture over toasted buns. Place patties on prepared kaiser buns and season with salt and pepper. Top burgers with 4 slices bacon, 2 slices tomato, and 1 lettuce leaf.</li></p>
